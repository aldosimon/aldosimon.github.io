I'm moving to static web hosting, since the last wordpress installation got infected with emotet :(

Old post are going to be moved when I have the willpower, and some will obviously had weird markdowns.

The new site was built using [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now "jekyll-now"), and  hosted in github.  I'm also using image found [cleanpng](https://www.cleanpng.com/), [pexels](https://www.pexels.com/), [unsplash](https://unsplash.com), [pixabay](https://pixabay.com) and  [disqus](https://disqus.com/) as a comment system.
