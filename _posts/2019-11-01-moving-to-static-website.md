I'm moving to static web hosting, since the last wordpress installation got infected with emotet :(
Old post are going to be moved when I have the willpower.

The new site was built using [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now "jekyll-now"), and  hosted in github.  I'm also using image found [cleanpng](https://www.cleanpng.com/), [pexels](https://www.pexels.com/), [unsplash](https://unsplash.com), [pixabay](https://pixabay.com) <s>and disqus as a comment system</s>.
