#### intro

Around one year back, [this site](aldosimon.com) was breached. This is the second time it happened. The first time was through [remote file inclusion](https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/rfi-remote-file-inclusion/). I wrote my own 'so called' blog cms, which is immensely simple, but had a built in feature of remote file inclusion.

#### what happened

The second breach happened around a year back, I started seeing my domain being blocked by several firewall. Upon looking at my hosting, which happened oh so rarely - the blog is not well maintained mind you, I see a lot of weirdly named folder.
