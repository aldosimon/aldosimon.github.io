I got the chance to co-teach at a university on network forensic through the praktisi mengajar program. The topic was on network forensic, and the overall experience was fun.
I might have misjudged the knowledge of university students, something that I planned to do better if another similar chance arrived.
The network forensic class co-teach took half a semester (i.e. 4 meetings @ 2 hour) and I cover suricata and wireshark (super briefly).
anywho, here are my most favourite documentation of all the classes, the dude in the middle is a lot like me when I'm doing my job, super confused
I practically didn't take any documentation at all, another thing I'm gonna work out next time around.
