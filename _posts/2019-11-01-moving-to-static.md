I'm moving to static web hosting, old post are going to be moved when I have the willpower :D

The new built using [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now "jekyll-now") or just plain jekyll in the future, and probably gonna be hosted in github or other static web hosting.  I'm also using image found here [logo](https://www.freepik.com/3ab2ou)
