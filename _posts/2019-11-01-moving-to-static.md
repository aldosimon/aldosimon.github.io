I'm moving to static web hosting, since the last wordpress installation got emotet :(.
Old post are going to be moved when I have the willpower :D

The new site was built using [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now "jekyll-now"), and  hosted in github.  I'm also using image found [here](https://www.cleanpng.com/) and  [disqus](https://disqus.com/) as a comment system.
