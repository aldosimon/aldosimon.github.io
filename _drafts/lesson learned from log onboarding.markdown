Some lesson learned from a log onboarding process:
* workstream block each other
* scope creeping
* unclear alert have minimums alert instead
* choosing the right log to onboard/ visibility
* threat modelling that focus on detection, a lot of threat modelling exercise result is hard to translate into detection.
* have a typical generic use case with requirement that should be on the log. have it group as STRIDE maybe? will be easier for user to see which one matches their cases.
